# Weather Demo üå•Ô∏è

Weather Demo is a SwiftUI-based weather application created as part of a learning journey in mobile app development.
This project showcases real-time weather information with a visually engaging interface, featuring dynamic background colors
and weather icons that adapt based on current weather conditions and the time of day. 
Users can explore detailed weather data, including temperature, wind speed, and humidity, presented through a sleek and interactive design. 
The app uses a weather API for accurate updates and serves as a practical example of integrating APIs, managing state, and applying SwiftUI principles.
This project aims to enhance my understanding of mobile development concepts and SwiftUI capabilities.
